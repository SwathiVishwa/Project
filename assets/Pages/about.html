<h3> The Principal</h3>
<p> I am delighted to be leading this fast growing Institute, which is making positive ripples by evolving high quality engineers. It is also located in the industrial city of Coimbatore facilitating internships, industrial visits and placements in core engineering companies.
      At SriGuru – the abode of Gurus, we strongly believe that education involves the body, mind and spirit. We have designed holistic education pedagogy where the students are able to excel not only in education but also in the field of sports and culture. They are also sensitised to the rich scientific & cultural heritage of our country.</p>
     <p> We have deployed an innovative pedagogy based on multiple intelligence with special focus on project based learning, in which the students are made to put the theory into practice thereby enabling them to understand and apply the subject knowledge more thoroughly. This also helps them to launch themselves confidently into entrepreneurial pursuits or a good job or into higher studies. The creative energy of the student is unleashed in this evolutionary educational process. In addition to this, the diverse collaborative MOUs with leading corporate houses are adding immense value to the students and also makes them industry ready, right from day one of their graduation.</p>
     <p> We advocate sports for an able body supplemented with yoga and meditation for developing a compassionate spirit, longing to realize its goals through selfless service to the society.</p>
     <p> We will leave no stone unturned to continuously explore new possibilities for the growth and development of our students. We are marching towards greater laurels based on the strength of our dedicated faculty & staff, visionary management and aspiring students.
